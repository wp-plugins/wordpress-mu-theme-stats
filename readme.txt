Adds submenu to see theme stats, shows themes by user and most popular themes.

== Description ==

Adds a Theme Stats option to the site admin menu. The admin panel lists all the themes in use site-wide. At the top of the list will be the most popular theme and a number in brackets of how many are in use. Click on the name, and a drop-down list will appear of all blogs using that theme, with a link to each blog's home and dashboard.

This plugin goes in the mu-plugins folder. This is an updated version of the theme stats (for subdomain installs) plugin we released in 2007. This version is designed for either subdomain or subdirectory installs.
