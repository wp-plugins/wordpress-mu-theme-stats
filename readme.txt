Adds theme usage statistics within your network, shows themes by user and most popular themes.

== Description ==

Adds a Theme Stats option to the super admin menu. The admin panel lists all the themes in use site-wide. At the top of the list will be the most popular theme and a number in brackets of how many are in use. Click on the name, and a drop-down list will appear of all blogs using that theme, with a link to each blog's home and dashboard.

This plugin goes in the mu-plugins folder. This is an updated version of the theme stats (for subdomain installs) plugin we released in 2007. This version is designed for either subdomain or subdirectory installs.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `ra-theme-stats.php` to the `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` directory or install as regular plugin and activate network-wide.
